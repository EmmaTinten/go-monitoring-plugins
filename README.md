# go-monitoring-plugins

A small (hopefully growing) collection of monitoring-plugins for Icinga2 etc. written in Golang.

## Make

For Linux builds just checkout, have a go toolchain installed and run 

```sh
make build
```

or 

```sh
make build-static
```

for static binaries. The make process will place them under bin/. You habe to install the files yourself.
